## Run 3: Increase DataLoaders
- **Hypothesis**: Increasing `num_workers` from 2 to 4 will reduce the data loading bottleneck, allowing the GPU to be fed faster and thus decreasing the total training time. Accuracy should be nearly identical.
- **Description**: Same as baseline, but with `num_workers=4`.
- **Total Training Time**: 135.00 seconds
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: 69.56%
- **Configuration**: `num_workers=4`, `BATCH_SIZE=512`, `SGD(lr=0.01)`
- **Result**: Didn't help on Google Colab T4 GPU. Logged warning:
    ```
    warnings.warn(
    /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py:624: UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 4 worker processes in total. Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 2, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.
    ```

## Run 4: Pre-populate and Normalize the Data before creating DataLoaders
- **Hypothesis**: The DataLoaders are a bottleneck. Repeatedly loading and normalizing the data.
- **Description**: Pre-populate the dataset and normalize it in tensor form before creating DataLoaders. 
  However, we're still loading each batch onto the device during training.
- **Hardware:** Google Colab (Python 3 Google Compute Engine backend), T4 GPU.
- **Configuration**: `num_workers=2`, `BATCH_SIZE=512`, `SGD(lr=0.01)`
- **Result**: Huge speedup! The repeated loading and normalizing of the data into tensor form was a huge bottleneck!
- **Total Training Loop Time**: 23.31 seconds (!!!)
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: 69.64%

## Run 5: Pre-load and Normalize the Data and Move it all to the Device
- **Hypothesis**: Repatedly sending the batches to the device is a bottleneck.
- **Description**: Crate the DataLoaders in one huge batch and load it onto the device before training.
- **Hardware:** Google Colab (Python 3 Google Compute Engine backend), T4 GPU.
- **Configuration**: `num_workers=2`, `BATCH_SIZE=512`, `SGD(lr=0.01)`
- **Result**: Further speedup! The repeated sending of the batches to the device was a bottleneck!
- **Data Pre-Load Before Training**: 15.24 seconds
- **Total Training Loop Time**: 13.73 seconds (!!!)
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: 69.81%

Same code run locally on desktop (CPU):
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment.
- **Data Pre-Load Before Training**: 12.87 seconds
- **Total Training Loop Time**: 195.08 seconds
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: 70.61%

## Run 6: Ablation Study - Remove RGB Normalization
- **Hypothesis**: The RGB normalization helps improve the accuracy faster.
- **Description**: Comment out the normalization step in the transforms:
   ```
   transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010))
   ```
```

- **Result**: The final accuracy is significantly lower without normalization (59.99% vs. 70.61%), 
  indicating that it plays an important role in training effectiveness.

## Run 7: Experiment 2.1 - Adam Optimizer
- **Hypothesis**: Adam optimizer will converge faster and potentially achieve better final accuracy than SGD.
- **Description**: Switch from SGD to Adam optimizer, adjusting learning rate from 0.01 (SGD) to 0.001 (Adam). Also tested lr=0.0004 based on common Adam defaults.
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment.

```
**Analysis**: Adam shows faster initial convergence than SGD, but the final accuracy with lr=0.001 is only comparable to SGD, and lr=0.0004 underperforms. For this simple CNN on CIFAR-10, Adam does not outperform well-tuned SGD in final accuracy; tuning learning rate matters significantly.

## Run 8: Add BatchNorm2d (CPU)
- **Hypothesis**: BatchNorm should stabilize training and improve final accuracy.
- **Description**: Insert BatchNorm2d after each conv layer: Conv -> BN -> ReLU -> Pool. Keep optimizer as plain SGD (no momentum), lr=0.01; BATCH_SIZE=512; EPOCHS=10. Same preloading and normalization as prior runs.
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment (CPU).
- **Configuration**: SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.0), BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10, BatchNorm2d after conv1/conv2.
- **Observation**: Per-epoch time on CPU increased substantially with BN compared to prior CPU runs.

Finished Training. Training loop time: 314.56 seconds
Final Validation Accuracy: 63.36%
```

**Analysis**: On CPU, adding BatchNorm2d increased per-epoch time substantially and reduced final accuracy relative to the previous CPU baseline (~70%). Likely causes: BN kernels are slower on CPU; momentum was not used (BN often pairs well with SGD+momentum); hyperparameters not re-tuned for BN. Next steps: test SGD+momentum=0.9 with BN, and/or run on GPU where BN is much faster.

### Run 8b: BatchNorm2d + SGD Momentum=0.9 (CPU)
- **Hypothesis**: Adding momentum with BN should improve convergence and recover/beat baseline accuracy.
- **Description**: Same as Run 8 (BN after conv1/conv2), but use SGD with momentum=0.9; lr=0.01; BATCH_SIZE=512; EPOCHS=10.
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment (CPU).
- **Configuration**: SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9), BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10, BatchNorm2d after conv1/conv2.

```

**Analysis**: Momentum with BN restores and surpasses the earlier CPU baseline, reaching 71.83% final accuracy. However, CPU epoch times remain higher with BN (~29–31s vs ~20s without BN). Next isolation: test plain SGD + momentum=0.9 without BN to quantify momentum’s standalone contribution.

### Run 8c: Remove BatchNorm, keep SGD Momentum=0.9 (CPU)
- **Hypothesis**: Isolate the benefit of momentum alone without BN overhead.
- **Description**: USE_BN=False (no BatchNorm), optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9), BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10.
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment (CPU).
- **Configuration**: Plain SimpleCNN (no BN), SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9), BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10.

```

**Analysis**: Momentum alone (no BN) restores accuracy to ~70.6% and keeps epoch time close to the faster, pre-BN runs (~20–22s). Conclusion: on CPU, BN adds notable overhead and didn’t help accuracy in this small CNN, while momentum=0.9 provides a clear benefit with minimal time cost. On GPU, BN would likely be faster and may still help; locally on CPU, prefer plain CNN + momentum for speed/accuracy trade-off.

### Run 8d: No BN, SGD momentum=0.9, weight_decay=5e-4 (CPU)
- **Hypothesis**: Adding standard weight decay should improve generalization slightly over momentum-only.
- **Description**: USE_BN=False, optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=5e-4), BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10.
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment (CPU).

```

**Analysis**: With weight decay, final accuracy here slightly underperformed momentum-only (~69.3% vs ~70.6%) on this run, though differences can be within run-to-run variance. Time remained in the faster ~19–20s/epoch band without BN. Next, consider trying cosine LR scheduling or tuning weight_decay (e.g., 1e-4 to 5e-4) to see if accuracy improves, or run multiple seeds to reduce variance effects.

### Run 8e: No BN, SGD momentum=0.9 + Cosine LR Schedule (CPU)
- **Hypothesis**: Cosine annealing can improve generalization and final accuracy over a fixed LR.
- **Description**: USE_BN=False, optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9), CosineAnnealingLR over 10 epochs, no weight decay; BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10.
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment (CPU).
- **Configuration**: Plain SimpleCNN (no BN), SGD(lr=0.01, momentum=0.9), cosine schedule (T_max=10), BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10.

```

**Analysis**: Cosine schedule underperformed the fixed-LR momentum baseline on this architecture/dataset split (66.5% vs ~70–71%). Likely the LR decay was too aggressive over only 10 epochs with no warmup. If retrying cosine, consider either a higher initial LR (e.g., 0.02), a warmup epoch, or extending total epochs. For now, fixed LR=0.01 with momentum=0.9 (no BN) remains the best CPU speed/accuracy trade-off observed.

### Run 8f: No BN, SGD lr=0.02, momentum=0.9 (CPU)
- **Hypothesis**: A slightly higher LR with momentum may improve final accuracy within 10 epochs.
- **Description**: USE_BN=False, fixed LR=0.02, momentum=0.9, no weight decay, no scheduler; BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10.
- **Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment (CPU).

**Analysis**: Increasing LR to 0.02 with momentum=0.9 improves final accuracy to 71.87% while maintaining ~19–20s epochs on CPU. This now matches/exceeds the BN+momentum result but with better training speed locally. This appears to be the best CPU configuration so far for this small CNN without augmentation.

- Hypothesis: Re-enabling cosine with the stronger lr=0.02 + momentum=0.9 baseline may improve generalization over fixed LR within 10 epochs.
- Description: USE_BN=False, optimizer=SGD(lr=0.02, momentum=0.9), CosineAnnealingLR with T_max=10; BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10; no weight decay; same preloading pipeline.
- Hardware: AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Radeon Graphics, WSL environment (CPU).
- Configuration: SimpleCNN (no BN), SGD(lr=0.02, momentum=0.9), cosine schedule (T_max=10), BATCH_SIZE=512, EPOCHS=10.

- Result: Cosine with lr=0.02, momentum=0.9 essentially matches the best fixed-LR baseline (71.78% vs 71.87%) with similar time (~195–197s total). Over only 10 epochs, cosine does not clearly outperform fixed LR; it may benefit more from longer horizons or a brief warmup. Next: consider EPOCHS=30–50, CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts, or modest LR sweeps.

## Run 9: ResNet-9 Model (Google Colab, T4 GPU)
- **Hypothesis**: A deeper model with residual connections and BatchNorm should improve accuracy significantly.

```

**Analysis**: 
- Significant accuracy improvement: 75.54% vs previous best of 71.87% (Run 8f)
- Training dynamics show strong learning but potential overfitting:
  - Loss decreases rapidly to near-zero (0.0084)
  - Validation accuracy continues improving despite very low loss
  - Some fluctuation in middle epochs (67-70%)
- Slower training due to:
  - Larger model (11.2M parameters)
  - BatchNorm operations
  - Residual connections
  - ~44s/epoch (GPU) vs ~20s/epoch for SimpleCNN (CPU)
- The accuracy gain justifies the increased training time
- Next steps:
  1. Add data augmentation to combat overfitting
  2. Consider adding dropout
  3. Try lower learning rate (e.g., 0.01) to stabilize training

**Analysis**: 
- Notable improvements over Run 9:
  1. Higher final accuracy: 76.79% vs 75.54%
  2. Better generalization: loss stays higher (0.5015 vs 0.0084) indicating less overfitting
  3. More stable training progression
  4. Peak validation accuracy of 80.01% in epoch 9
- Training characteristics:
  - Slower initial convergence due to augmentation (expected)
  - More consistent validation accuracy improvements
  - Training time similar to non-augmented version (~45s/epoch)
  - Data loading much faster (1.91s vs 23.35s) due to batch loading
- The README's prediction was correct: data augmentation pushed accuracy well above 75%
- Next potential improvements:
  1. Try longer training (e.g., 20 epochs) since accuracy was still improving
  2. Test with cosine learning rate schedule
  3. Experiment with additional augmentations (e.g., ColorJitter)

## Run 11: Large Batch Size Experiment (Google Colab, T4 GPU)

- **Hardware**: Google Colab (Python 3 Google Compute Engine backend), T4 GPU.
- **Configuration**:
  - Model: ResNet-9 (11,173,962 parameters)

```

**Analysis**: 
- **Major performance regression**: 58.41% vs previous best of 76.79% (Run 10)
- **Slower total time**: 658.81s vs 453.69s for baseline batch size 512
- **Poor convergence**: Much slower learning, peaked around 56-58% accuracy
- **Epoch timing**: Started at ~52s, increased to ~70s (vs ~45s baseline)
- **Learning dynamics**: Very slow initial convergence, suggesting learning rate mismatch

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Learning rate too low for large batch**: LR=0.02 optimal for batch=512, but large batches typically need proportionally higher LR
2. **Gradient averaging effect**: Larger batches smooth gradients too much, slowing learning
3. **No LR scaling applied**: Rule of thumb is to scale LR proportionally with batch size

**Conclusions**:
- Large batch size (3072) significantly hurts both speed and accuracy without LR adjustment
- The "linear scaling rule" (LR ∝ batch_size) should be tested: try LR=0.12 (0.02 × 6)
- For time-to-accuracy optimization, batch size 512 remains superior
- Next experiments should focus on other speedup techniques (torch.compile, mixed precision)

**Recommendation**: Revert to batch size 512 and focus on other optimizations.

## Run 12: Smaller Batch Size Experiment (Google Colab, T4 GPU)
- **Hypothesis**: Reducing batch size from 512 to 256 might improve convergence despite lower GPU utilization.

- **Peak accuracy**: 81.28% at epoch 8, showing strong learning dynamics
- **Consistent epoch timing**: Stable ~41-44s per epoch
- **Better convergence**: Smooth, monotonic improvement through most epochs

**Key Insights**:
1. **More gradient updates**: 195 batches/epoch vs 98 (batch 512) = more frequent parameter updates
2. **Optimal gradient noise**: Enough randomness to escape local minima, not too smooth
3. **Faster data loading**: 1.73s vs 9.70s (batch 3072) due to smaller batch processing
4. **Sweet spot discovered**: Batch 256 balances training stability, speed, and final accuracy

**Training Dynamics**:
- Rapid initial convergence: 43% → 68% → 74% in first 4 epochs
- Continued improvement: Peak 81.28% at epoch 8
- Stable final performance: 80.51% with minimal overfitting

**Conclusions**:
- **New baseline established**: Batch size 256 is optimal for this ResNet-9 + CIFAR-10 setup
- **Contradicts conventional wisdom**: Smaller batch size outperformed larger ones
- **Time-to-accuracy champion**: Best combination of speed and final accuracy achieved
- **Robust training**: Consistent performance without hyperparameter tuning

**Next experiments should build on this batch 256 baseline**:
1. Test torch.compile with batch 256 for additional speedup
2. Try mixed precision training
3. Experiment with cosine learning rate schedule
4. Extend to 15-20 epochs to see if 82%+ is achievable

## Run 13: torch.compile and GPU Sync Optimization (Google Colab, T4 GPU)
- **Hypothesis**: Adding torch.compile and eliminating GPU syncs from loss.item() should provide additional speedup over the batch 256 baseline.
- **Description**: Same as Run 12 but with torch.compile enabled and epoch loss accumulated on GPU tensor to avoid CPU↔GPU syncs.
- **Hardware**: Google Colab (Python 3 Google Compute Engine backend), T4 GPU.
- **Configuration**:
  - Model: ResNet-9 (11,173,962 parameters)
  - BatchNorm: True

**Analysis**:

**torch.compile Performance:**
- **Massive first-epoch overhead**: 148.70s vs ~41s baseline (3.6× slower)
- **Subsequent epochs faster**: 40.72s vs 41-44s baseline (~3-7% speedup)
- **Net effect for 10 epochs**: ~517s vs ~430s baseline (20% slower overall)
- **Would pay off**: Only for 15+ epoch runs or multiple sequential experiments

**GPU Sync Optimization:**
- **No measurable improvement**: 41.68s vs 41-44s baseline
- **Why it didn't help**:
  1. Only ~195 batches per epoch (not thousands)
  2. GPU utilization already good with batch size 256
  3. Validation syncs likely dominate any training sync overhead
  4. T4 GPU efficiently handles the sync pattern

**Conclusions**:
1. **torch.compile not recommended** for single 10-epoch runs due to compilation overhead
2. **GPU sync optimization unnecessary** for this batch size and model configuration
3. **Current setup already efficient**: Batch 256 baseline remains optimal
4. **Diminishing returns**: Further micro-optimizations unlikely to provide significant gains

**Recommendation**: Stick with the simple, clean Run 12 configuration (batch 256, no torch.compile, standard loss tracking) for best time-to-accuracy performance.

## Run 14: Even Smaller Batch Size - 128 (Google Colab, T4 GPU)
- **Hypothesis**: Further reducing batch size from 256 to 128 might provide even better convergence through increased gradient noise and more frequent updates.

- **Peak accuracy breakthrough**: 84.71% at epoch 8 - first time crossing 84%+ barrier
- **More gradient updates**: 390 batches/epoch vs 195 (batch 256) = doubled parameter update frequency
- **Excellent training dynamics**: Smooth progression with strong learning throughout
- **Maintained efficiency**: 41-45s per epoch, similar to batch 256 timing
- **Slight overfitting pattern**: Peak 84.71% → final 82.62%, suggesting potential for longer training with LR scheduling

**Key Insights**:
1. **Batch size pattern emerges**: 512→76.79%, 256→80.51%, 128→82.62% - clear inverse relationship
2. **Optimal gradient noise**: Smaller batches provide better exploration and escape from local minima
3. **GPU efficiency maintained**: Despite smaller batches, epoch timing remains competitive
4. **Ready for longer training**: Strong learning curve suggests 15-20 epochs could reach 85%+

**Training Progression**:
- **Rapid early learning**: 52% → 67% → 74% in first 3 epochs
- **Steady mid-training gains**: Consistent 2-4% improvements per epoch
- **Strong peak performance**: 84.71% demonstrates the model's potential
- **Manageable overfitting**: Only 2% drop from peak suggests good generalization

**Conclusions**:
- **New champion configuration**: Batch 128 establishes new accuracy record
- **Validates small batch hypothesis**: More frequent updates and gradient noise benefit this architecture
- **Optimal for speedrunning**: Best accuracy achieved in ~442s
- **Perfect setup for extensions**: Ready for cosine scheduling and longer training

**Next Steps**:
1. **20 epochs + cosine LR**: Likely to stabilize around 84-85% by preventing late-stage overfitting
2. **Learning rate exploration**: Test if LR=0.025 or 0.015 further improves convergence
3. **Mixed precision**: Could provide additional speedup while maintaining accuracy
4. **Early stopping**: Monitor for peak accuracy to avoid overfitting in longer runs

**Recommendation**: Batch 128 is the new baseline - excellent accuracy with maintained speed efficiency.

- **Description**: Same as Run 21, but with `LEARNING_RATE` increased from 0.04 to 0.08.
- **Hardware**: Google Colab (Python 3 Google Compute Engine backend), T4 GPU.
- **Configuration**: `LR=0.08`, `BATCH_SIZE=64`, `EPOCHS=10`, `COSINE=True`, `AMP=True`
