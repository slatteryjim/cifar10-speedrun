● For speedrunning purposes, Run 15 with batch size 64 is the best choice.

  Here's why:

  1. Optimal speed-accuracy balance: 85.69% accuracy in 437 seconds
  2. Excellent time efficiency: ~44s per epoch vs 53s (batch 32) or 69s (batch 16)
  3. Strong performance: Only 1.49% lower accuracy than the absolute best (batch 32) but 22% faster
  4. Consistent results: Smooth training curve with minimal overfitting

  While batch 32 achieves slightly higher accuracy (87.18%), the 22% time penalty makes it less suitable for speedrunning where time-to-result matters most.

● For a 20-epoch run with batch size 64, I recommend:

  Configuration:
  - BATCH_SIZE = 64
  - EPOCHS = 20
  - LEARNING_RATE = 0.02 (keep current)
  - USE_COSINE = True ✅

  Why enable cosine scheduling:
  - Your Run 15 showed peak accuracy at epoch 9 (86.47%) with slight decline to 85.69% by epoch 10
  - Cosine annealing will help maintain performance in later epochs by gradually reducing LR
  - Perfect for 20-epoch runs where you want stable convergence without overfitting

  Expected results:
  - Should achieve 87-88% accuracy based on your smooth learning curve
  - Cosine will prevent the slight accuracy drop seen in epoch 10
  - Total time: ~14-15 minutes (20 × 44s per epoch)

> Is there any other data augmentation we should try?
  ⎿  ⧉ Selected 58 lines from main.py in Visual Studio Code

● For CIFAR-10 speedrunning, I'd suggest trying these additional augmentations:

  High impact, low cost:
  - transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2, saturation=0.2, hue=0.1) - often gives 1-2% boost
  - transforms.RandomRotation(15) - slight rotation helps generalization

  Worth testing:
  - transforms.RandomErasing(p=0.5) - cutout-style augmentation, can improve robustness
  - transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=0, translate=(0.1, 0.1)) - slight translation

  Current setup is already strong with RandomCrop + RandomHorizontalFlip, which are the most effective for CIFAR-10.

  I'd recommend testing ColorJitter first since it's most likely to help without slowing training much. Want to try it in the next run?

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Record Run 18 results in experiments.md

● Excellent! Run 18 is now recorded in experiments.md. You achieved 90.68% accuracy - a massive breakthrough! The 20-epoch run with cosine scheduling delivered
   a 4.99% improvement over the 10-epoch baseline, confirming that extended training with proper LR scheduling is highly beneficial for this architecture.

> I want to switch back to 10 epochs. With Cosine enabled, should I increase the learning rate?

● Yes, absolutely! For 10 epochs with cosine scheduling, you should increase the learning rate.

  Recommended config:
  - LEARNING_RATE = 0.03 (50% increase from 0.02)
  - EPOCHS = 10
  - USE_COSINE = True

  Rationale:
  - Cosine starts at peak LR and decays to ~0 over 10 epochs
  - With only 10 epochs, the decay is aggressive - need higher starting LR
  - Your 20-epoch run showed strong learning continued through epoch 15+
  - LR=0.03 should capture more of that learning in the compressed 10-epoch window

  Expected result: Should achieve 87-89% accuracy in ~7-8 minutes, significantly faster than the 15-minute 20-epoch run while maintaining strong performance.

  Want me to update the config?

> yes

       14 -      LEARNING_RATE = 0.02  # Start with current best LR
       14 +      LEARNING_RATE = 0.03  # Higher LR for 10 epochs + cosine
       15        BATCH_SIZE = 64
       16 -      EPOCHS = 20
       16 +      EPOCHS = 10
       17        USE_BN = True  # ResNet typically benefits from BN
       18        USE_COSINE = True
       19        

● Perfect! Configuration updated:
  - LR: 0.03 (50% increase for aggressive 10-epoch cosine decay)
  - Epochs: 10 (back to speedrun length)
  - Cosine: Enabled
  - Batch size: 64 (optimal from previous experiments)

  Ready to run on Colab. Should achieve strong performance (~87-89%) in ~7-8 minutes.
